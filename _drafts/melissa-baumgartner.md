Healing Hands co-founder, mission secretary, and the Director of Nursing and Clinical Operations, Melissa Baumgartner on why she traveled to Guatemala the first time and keeps coming back:

My journey began when I saw an advertisement for a Medical Mission in my church bulletin. I had always wanted to go on a mission trip, it was on my “bucket list”. I couldn’t get the desire to go off my my mind. You could say I was being “called”. After the experience I was so moved by the people of Guatemala, their culture, faith and desperate need for medical care that Dr Woodward and I decided to found Healing Hands Mission. I admire the Guatemalans work ethic and deep appreciation for what we do.
