We are very sad to say that the man who has made this mission possible in his own parish in Guatemala has now been transferred to a new parish. We thank him for everything he has done to help the mission and his people and we wish him luck in his new home, serving Christ. This is the letter he wrote to us:

“Dear Brothers in Christ, Dr Kevin, Dr Graham and Tom Olp.

I am writing to let you know that I have been designated as pastor of Our Lady of Pilar Parish in Arizona, Atl&aacute;ntida, Honduras. A very large rural parish, of 65 very poor peasant communities in the Cordillera de Nombre de Dios.

I was 14 years in the mission of Semaj&iacute;, and thanks to peopleas generous and human as you, we could do something for the communities Qeqchies and Ladinas that live with so much poverty and abandonment on the part of our governments. I want to thank you with all my heart for all the good you have done and I would like to ask you to continue to help our people. Father Abel Carbajal Calles is the new Pastor and I hope you will support him as you supported me so that together You can continue with the social assistance works. Dr. Kevin, in addition to so many things, especially thank you for the help for Lydia, as the Lord allowed us to see the miracle of seeing her walk after 14 years bedridden. To all of You Tom Olp and Dr Graham, Dr.Gruba, Melissa and team for the construction works, the medical days, through which we also saw miracles, of the blind that they saw again after years of not seeing, and so many wonderful things that You were able to do. Thanks alsoDr. Kevin for the support for so many years to the San Pablo Institute in Tamag&aacute;s. May God allow You to continue performing miracles. May God multiply in blessings all that You did for our people.

Atte,

P. Javier Hern&aacute;ndez Q, cmf.”
