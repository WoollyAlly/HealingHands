As the holidays approach and 2018 draws to a close, it feels natural to reflect upon the accomplishments that many of you &nbsp;have helped Healing Hands Medical Mission achieve this year. We hope you take a moment to consider donating to our organization this Giving Tuesday.

WHAT WE DO

In June, we made our fourth annual trip to San Antonio de Padua Parish in remote Eastern Guatemala, where we provided medical care to over 1,000 residents in just four days. 2018 saw our biggest group of providers to date: a record number of volunteers including 33 nurses, doctors, and students, came together to journey to the Parish. This year, Parishioners were especially grateful to receive care from Maria Luisa de Leon, a dentist who practices in Guatemala City. Maria was touched and inspired by our mission, and we are thrilled to count her as one of our partners in providing care to the rural families in years to come.

DONATE TODAY

On behalf of our volunteers and the Board of Healing Hands Medical Mission, we wish you a Merry Christmas and all the blessings for the New Year. Please know that any kindness, even small, can touch the lives of so many in unexpected, beautiful ways. At this time during our Annual Appeal we are asking that you prayerfully consider a donation so that we may continue our mission of service to the poor of rural Guatemala.
