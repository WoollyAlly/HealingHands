#### BIG THANKS\!

Dr. Michael S. Scherer, DDS for the generous donation to sponsor the renovation of the dental suite at the San Antonio de Padua. His donation is greatly appreciated by our patients and volunteers alike. With it we will be modernizing the existing suite so that we can provide the best care possible to our patients. We will keep you updated on progress.
