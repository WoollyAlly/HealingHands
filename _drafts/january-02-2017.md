It was reorganized this year into a nonprofit foundation with officers, a board of directors, website and Facebook page. There is now a leadership team and person responsible for each area â€“ nursing, medical, logistics, security and fundraising. Several area churches have stepped up to become key supporters, including St. Patrick Parish, St. John Neumann Church, Baker Memorial United Methodist Church and St. Michael in Wheaton. The total number of donors has grown to about 100 through various activities, fundraisers and gifts.

The second-year expansion has capitalized on the lessons learned and the experiences of last year. The investments were still watched closely so that the additional donations were put to good use in helping the sick in Guatemala. The cost to each volunteer traveling to Guatemala was kept to about $1,200. The remaining costs were for more supplies, medicine and equipment at steep discounts. Volunteers transported 20 suitcases full of medication and supplies through airport security without a problem to ensure they arrived at their destination. Some of the medication was left behind for continued treatment of asthma, burns, sepsis, diabetes, hypertension, anemia and prenatal vitamins (basic medicine we take for granted).
