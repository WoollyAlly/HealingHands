# HEALING HANDS MEDICAL MISSION NEWSLETTER

WINTER 2023

# Trivia Night Fundraiser Updates

Thank you to everyone that attended, donated, and worked hard to make this event possible. Thanks to St. Charles Moose Lodge \# 1368 we were able to host over 160 trivia experts! It was so fun for us to see everyone come together for such a wonderful night and to support our organization. Special thanks to our musical guest for the evening, Marirose Rueth (Instagram @mrueth45) , for a beautiful performance. We were very fortunate to have an original painting donated by Guatemalan translator/artist, Geovani Chiquin. We are so thankful to our friend Geovani for sharing his talents with us and so elated that one of our donors went home with a beautiful, one-of-a-kind piece of art. Thanks to your generosity, we were able to raise $10,000! This will go towards medications, supplies, an ultrasound machine, in addition to supporting our in-country missionary and translators. By supporting the mission, you are able to help provide medical, nursing, pharmacy, and dental care to patients in the rural Eastern Guatemalan department of Izabal.

# Upcoming Mission

Coming soon… keep an eye out in our next newsletter to hear how the March 2023 Mission went! A team of 7 will travel to rural Guatemala to provide care in a more intimate setting, visit neighboring villages, and meet with local midwives. The March mission is critical to provide access to care and to trouble shoot any potential challenges before the main mission in June.
