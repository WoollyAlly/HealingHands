The students and families of St. Francis College Preparatory of Wheaton, IL came together this Lenten season to give of their time and hearts as they gathered and prepared hygiene kits for the upcoming June mission. We were truly overwhelmed by the love and support of this community.&nbsp; St. Francis was able to donate over 300 prepared hygiene kits (plus extra supplies\!) that included soap, shampoo, conditioner, toothpaste, toothbrushes, deodorant, and more. Thank you St. Francis for your help providing for our patients\!&nbsp;
