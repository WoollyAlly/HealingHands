Hi! As most of you know our medical mission has a significant impact on the health of the indigenous Mayan population of San Antonio de Padua Parish. Our most recent initiative is to educate and provide supplies to the 40 nurse midwives who serve the 80 villages in the area. The rural population has a high maternal and infant mortality rate which is compounded by lack of prenatal care, lack of supplies for pre and post natal care, and that the nearest hospital is over 3 hours away by dirt road. We are reaching out to our supporters to let you know that we have registered with Amazon Smile which provides an easy way to support us. If you wish to help and are unfamiliar with the program:

1. log on to amazon with your username and password

2. you may get a prompt to register, if not click below the support bar on “supporting”.

4. select “Healing Hands Medical Mission” in St. Charles, IL.

Thanks for your help!
