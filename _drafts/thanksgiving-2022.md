We are so thankful to all of our volunteers and donors for all the hard work throughout the year to benefit our patients\! We are so humbled and blessed to be able to care for the communities of Eastern Guatemala and so thankful for the continued support and relationship with the community. “Not all of us can do great things, but we can all do small things with great love” God bless
