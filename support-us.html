                    As we continue to grow as an organization, we try to accomplish something new each year, whether it's providing the community with more medical supplies or finding ways to provide our patients with continuing care. This is where we will keep you updated on our plans for upcoming trips. You can also check each trip's individual page to&nbsp; view all of the pictures and see what we've accomplished.<br /><br />If you or someone you know are interested in coming on our mission, donating medical supplies, or have any questions, send us an email at info@healinghandsmission.com.
