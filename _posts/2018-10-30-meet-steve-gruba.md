Meet Steve Gruba (on the right). A wonderful retired physician who has come with us many times.

He’s an expert on parasites and water sanitation. <br>“I look forward to the mission trip every year because I always come home grateful for what I have here in food variety, comfortable living quarters, spending money and general safety to name a few. Plus, it’s always satisfying to suffer a little bit to help out the number of people we do in the short time we are there.” - Steve Gruba, MD
