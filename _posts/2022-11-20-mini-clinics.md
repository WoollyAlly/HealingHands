Our in-country missionary (and superstar\!) Hector spent the last few weeks putting on “mini-clinics” in the villages of Sahila, La Libertad, and El Florido with the help of his niece Kristhel, who is currently studying medicine. In between trips to bring patients to Fray Hospital, Hector has been visiting neighboring villages to provide blood sugar checks for diabetic patients, blood pressure checks for patients with high blood pressure, and food for elderly patients. For many of our patients, it is too expensive to own a blood glucose monitor or blood pressure cuff. By providing this crucial service, patients can gain a better understanding of their health. Hector truly is the life-blood of our mission and wants his people to know our goal is that “we try to make your life a little less forgotten, a little less rejected… a little more included”.&nbsp;
