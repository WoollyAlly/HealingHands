Healing Hands Medical Mission’s Third Annual Trivia Fundraiser is fast approaching\!

The event is coming together as another spectacular evening of good times including grooving to the beat of live Latin Music, good food and drinks, and an intense Trivia competition with outstanding prizes\! I have been asked, **"Where does the money that we raise go?"**

As many of you know HHMM has been serving the many villagers of San Antonio de Padua parish for over five years. Your past donations have enabled us to provide medical care to literally thousands of patients. We have installed a state-of-the-art dental clinic, built dorms for our volunteers, modernized the water system, bought a transport van, and provided financial support for Hector, our full-time missionary, who coordinates care to those in need when we are not present.

Currently, we are sending money so that Hector can provide boxes of food to those who are suffering from starvation due to the Pandemic. In addition, Hector is providing rides so that our patients can get to the nearest vaccination site. **So your donation saves lives…by providing much-needed medical care, food, and access to the vaccine.**

*Charles G. Woodward, President, HHMM.*
