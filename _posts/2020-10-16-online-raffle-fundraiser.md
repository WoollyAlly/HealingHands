Dear Parish Family,

Healing Hands Medical Mission would like to update you on what has been happening since the pandemic began. Like all of us, our plans abruptly changed. Our medical mission that was scheduled in June as well as our annual Trivia Night Fundraiser had to be postponed.

We know our Guatemalan brothers and sisters still needed help. Our team regrouped and decided to send a portion of the money we’ve raised from donations last year, to help our indigenous communities abroad.

Our liaison, Hector Barrios, hand-delivers food, toiletries, and basic medications to the communities who have come to depend on us over the years. Our team of missionaries on the ground bought items locally in their country to serve over 200 families in these rural communities. Hector calls it "A Mission of Love."&nbsp;

Please visit our website at Healinghands.org to see pictures and consider donating to our mission. With your help, we can continue to serve this impoverished area that was hit hard economically in this unique time in our world.

To raise funds to continue to best serve our Guatemalan communities, we are hosting a virtual raffle\! You have a chance to enter a gift basket raffle when you make a monetary donation to our mission. All baskets have been donated by local merchants who support our cause. For each donation of $100 or more in the months of October, November, and December, you will be entered in the random drawing. We will be raffling 4 baskets—two in November and two in December. Prize winners will be notified at the end of each month, respectively.

Lastly, we are looking for non-medical volunteers who can assist us with outreach, fundraising, and administrative support.

Please contact Lisa Carani if you have any questions about donating or volunteering at [lcarani2@gmail.com](mailto:lcarani2@gmail.com).&nbsp;

God bless and thank you for your support\!<br>The Healing Hands Medical Mission Team
