She is one of our co-founders, our secretary, and our Director of Nursing and Clinical Operations.

She’s a Registered Nurse and works at Burlington Central High School as the school nurse. She has three wonderful daughters, two of which plan to follow in her footsteps and become nurses. The other is our Director of Visual Communications and Web Designer.“This my fifth year and every time I go I feel more and more connected to the people we serve. I admire the love they have for each other, no matter their circumstances and the warmth and welcome we receive…I’m blessed. As Hector would say, "I love this Country!”“<br>- Melissa Baumgartner, RN
