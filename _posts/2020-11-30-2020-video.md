## We Need YOUR Help

Over 66% of Indigenous Mayans suffer from chronic malnutrition. Over 80% of the Indigenous Mayans live in poverty. Over 66% of the Guatemalan population lives on less than $1 to $2 a day. We serve the Indigenous Mayans of San Antonio de Padua Parish in remote Eastern Guatemala. Our patients suffer from malnutrition, lack of access to healthcare, racial discrimination, and loss of their land. Currently, they are going through undue hardship, due to the pandemic. They are suffering from extreme hunger and loss of their meager income. There is no safety net. Please join Dr. Graham Woodward, President and Medical Director, and Healing Hands Medical Mission, in solidarity with our Guatemalan brothers and sisters by making a donation or joining our mission. We, and they, need your help.
