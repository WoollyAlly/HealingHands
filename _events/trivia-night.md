###### ***Due to the current circumstances with COVID-19, we felt it was best to cancel our fundraiser this year. We hope to see you next year\!&nbsp;******Thank you all for your understanding and stay healthy\!***

Please join us for a great event benefiting the Healing Hands Medical Mission. This event is a casual, fun-filled night of giving back to those in need. Your ticket price includes an Italian buffet-style dinner, six rounds of trivia, an award for the winning team, a prize for the best decorated table, the opportunity to purchase raffle basket tickets and join in on the split the pot raffle and more. Make sure you stay for an auction at the end of the evening including one of a kind bakery creations and original Guatemalan artwork.

All proceeds offset the costs of medical, dental, and vision supplies for our next mission trip to Guatemala. We also provide transportation for patients who need to see a specialist but are unable to get to the medical site on their own.
