Please join us for our Third Annual Trivia Night\!This event is a casual, fun-filled night of giving back to those in need and will be held outdoors in a covered pavillion and tentâ€”rain or shine. Your ticket includes a pizza and salad buffet, six rounds of trivia, a contest for the best decorated picnic table, the opportunity to purchase raffle basket and split-the-pot raffle tickets, a bonfire, and live Latin music. Stick around for an auction at the end of the evening including bakery creations and original Guatemalan handbags.

**All of the proceeds go to offset the cost of medical and dental supplies, and to provide transportation for our referral patients. We also aim to fund the construction of a dedicated eye care suite.**

*Tickets are $35 each and can be purchased starting on April 26.*
