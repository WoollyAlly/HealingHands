Please join us for our third annual Trivia Night. This event is a casual fun filled night of giving back to those in need. Your ticket includes buffet dinner, 6 rounds of trivia, the opportunity to purchase raffle basket tickets and / or join in a split the pot raffle as well as a prize awarded to the winning table. There will be delicious desserts donated by Indulge Bake Shop that can be purchased with the money going toward the mission. All of what we earn will directly benefit the Healing Hands Medical Mission this June in Guatemala.
