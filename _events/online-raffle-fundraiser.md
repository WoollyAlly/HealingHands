###### To raise funds to continue to best serve our Guatemalan communities, we are hosting a virtual raffle\!

You have a chance to enter a gift basket raffle when you make a monetary donation to our mission. All baskets have been donated by local merchants who support our cause. For each donation of $100 or more in the months of October, November, and December, you will be entered in the random drawing. We will be raffling 4 basketsâ€”two in November and two in December. Prize winners will be notified at the end of each month, respectively.

Please contact Lisa Carani if you have any questions about donating or volunteering at&nbsp;[lcarani2@gmail.com](mailto:lcarani2@gmail.com).&nbsp;
