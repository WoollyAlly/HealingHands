Healing Hands Medical Mission is Hosting a Trivia Night and all proceeds go to offset the cost of medicine, supplies and transportation for our Guatemalan patients who need medical attention. Arrange a group of 2-10 friends or family and start reviewing for TRIVIA. We're serving a buffet-style Italian dinner featuring 7 rounds of trivia. Our next Medical Mission to Guatemala is scheduled for June and we need your help to make it happen.

This event will include a full cash bar and we will have 50/50 Split the Pot and Raffle Gift Baskets available. Desserts available for purchase sponsored by Indulge Bake Shop. Contact Lisa Carani at 630-341-0913
