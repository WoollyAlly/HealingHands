Although this mini-mission was small in size, they sure were mighty\! This group of 14 saw nearly 300 patients in three days and three communities, ranging from 8 months to 90+ years. We were able to serve the communities of Sahila, Florido, and La Libertad. Most clinic days were held in large halls/community centers, but amazingly, one day we were actually in someone's garage. And it worked quite well.&nbsp;

Many people don't know the amount of planning, prep, and coordination these trips take. Our amigo Hector coordinates with local contacts, then reports back our our director about 4,000 miles away. Donated meds and equipment are packed up and shipped as luggage, otherwise it tends to disappear. We then travel 6-8 hours into rural Guatemala. All in all, it was four days of travel (including a cow traffic jam), one day of inventory and clinic setup, and three days of clinic. It is a journey to say the least.
