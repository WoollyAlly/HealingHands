The 2016 mission was the very first mission run by Graham Woodward and Melissa Baumgartner. They took the initiative of registering the mission as a 501(c)(3) organization. 

Before the trip in June they funded a building project to expand the dorms to comfortably fit more people, built bathrooms attached to the dorms, and helped repair the water system as well as a backup. Dr. Grouba brought along a water filtration system for drinking water to leave for the parish once we had left. This water filtration eliminated travelers sickness completely among our team. We also provided the parish with an AED and added a dentist and physical therapists to the team. In the four days of clinic, we saw 1,100 patients and were able to provide a wider range of medications than the year before.
