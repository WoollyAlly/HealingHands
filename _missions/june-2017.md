The June 2017 mission saw a record 1,000 patients. As for construction projects, we paid for windows and ceiling fans to be added to the medical clinic. We also provided the parish with a new stove and refrigerator to accommodate the increased amount of people attending the mission. As usual a couple Guatemalan doctors and our Creighton medical students accompanied us. And instead of bringing our own dentist, we hired a local dentist to help put food on another families plates.&nbsp; Although, we did not bring Physical Therapists this year, our eye doctor was able to see many more patients than in previous years, with the help of simple eye tests done in triage.
